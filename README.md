## Project Overview
Love the old school Asteroids game, but out of quarters? You've come to the right place. Comets is a space shoot em up game that lets you launch into space and blast through rocks big and small to rack up the highest score possible.

Space starts out pretty safe, with only minor debris to blow up and dodge. As you float, blast and glide through the colorful galaxy, the challenge picks up to be an avalanche of danger orbiting your way.

Space is a scary place, and while your score can soar as high as your purple rocket ship, eventually, your shield will give out from the pummeling and you'll have to launch a new adventure to see if you can spin through space a little bit longer next time!
